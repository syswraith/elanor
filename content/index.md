# elanor
Elanor is a minimalistic static site generator built for the Markdown I use.

Here's what you need to get started

- The installation and setup instructions are available here: [[./first install and setup.md]]
- You can choose your themes here: [[./themes.md]]


Elanor currently supports the following:

- Basic markdown formatting
- Syntax highlighting
- KaTeX rendering
- Frontmatter parsing

A great thanks to all the maintainers and contributors to the [[./libraries used.md]] in this project.
