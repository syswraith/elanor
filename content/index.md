# elanor
Elanor is a minimalistic static site generator built for the Markdown I use.

- The installation instructions are available here: [[./installation.md]].
- You can choose your themes here: [[./themes.md]].

Currently, Elanor has support for the following:
- Basic markdown formatting (bold, italic, tables, etc)
- Syntax highlighting for codeblocks
- Wikilinks
- KaTeX

A great thanks to all the maintainers and contributors to the [[./libraries used.md]] in this project.
