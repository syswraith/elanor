# elanor
Elanor is a minimalistic static site generator built for the Markdown I use.

Here's what you need to get started

- The installation instructions are available here: [[./installation.md]].
- You can choose your themes here: [[./themes.md]].
- Basic markdown formatting, along with tables, wikilinks, syntax highlighting and KaTeX are available.

A great thanks to all the maintainers and contributors to the [[./libraries used.md]] in this project.
